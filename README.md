## Nathaniel Horton

I am a student at the School of Data Science within the University of Virginia. I'm currently a second year student, and have been exploring data for the past few years through platforms like DataCamp, and plan to graduate in 2028. My personal experience includes Python, personal data collection and analysis, general git usage, and deploying to web-based services like Render. I'm looking to work with more data outside of my own personal collections like the ones I've been working with thus far. Below is a project I've created and worked on last semester (be wary of loading times as it's being run on a free service):

I would love to intern over the summer for game companies like Valve or id Software as well as more software-driven companies with a focus on statistics and analytics.
